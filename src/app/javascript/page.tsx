				JavaScript: Not Just Java&apos;s Weird Cousin!
			</h1>

			<div className="mb-8 space-y-4">
				<p>
					Ah, JavaScript! The magical pixie dust that makes websites wiggle,
					giggle, and occasionally throw a tantrum (we call those &apos;bugs&apos;, but
					&apos;unexpected features&apos; sounds nicer, right?).

					What&apos;s with the Yellow Square?
				</h2>
				<p>
					You&apos;ve probably seen it around: a bright yellow square with bold,
					black &quot;JS&quot; letters. Is that the official logo? Nope! JavaScript
					technically doesn&apos;t have an official logo mandated by the standards
					body (ECMA International).

					/>
				</div>
				<p>
					However, this yellow square has become the{' '}
					<span className="italic">de facto</span>, community-adopted symbol for
					JavaScript. It&apos;s simple, recognizable, and pops up everywhere â€“
					tutorials, stickers, conference banners. So, while not &quot;official&quot;,
					it&apos;s the logo most developers associate with the language.

					What is it, really?
				</h2>
				<p>
					Imagine your website is a house. HTML is the structure â€“ the walls,
					the roof. CSS is the interior design â€“ the paint colors, the fancy
					curtains. JavaScript? It&apos;s the electricity, the plumbing, the robot
					butler that brings you snacks! It makes things{' '}
					<span className="italic">happen</span>.

					Ever Heard of Vanilla JS?

				<p>
					You might hear developers talk about the &quot;Vanilla JS framework&quot;.
					Sounds fancy, right? Maybe a super-fast, cutting-edge library?
				</p>
				<p>
					Plot twist!{' '}
					<span className="font-bold">
						Vanilla JS is just plain, regular, standard JavaScript.
					</span>{' '}
					That&apos;s it! No frameworks, no libraries, just the raw language provided
					by your browser.
				</p>
				<p>
					It&apos;s a running joke in the community. Why &quot;vanilla&quot;? Like vanilla ice
					cream, it&apos;s the basic, unadorned original. Sometimes, you don&apos;t need
					fancy sprinkles (frameworks) â€“ the plain version works perfectly fine,
					is super lightweight, and has zero dependencies!

					app, just nod knowingly and appreciate the joke (and maybe their clean
					code!).

				</h2>
				<p>
					Good question! Back in the day (the internet equivalent of the
					Jurassic period), Java was the cool kid on the block. So, the creators
					of JavaScript thought, &quot;Hey, let&apos;s ride those coattails!&quot; It&apos;s like
					naming your pet hamster &quot;Dwayne &apos;The Rock&apos; Hamsterson&quot; â€“ mostly for
					marketing. They aren&apos;t closely related, despite the name!

					Deno vs. Oracle: The Battle for &quot;JavaScript&quot;
				</h2>
				<p>
					You might be surprised to hear that Oracle (yes,{' '}
					<span className="italic">that</span> Oracle) technically owns the
					trademark for the word &quot;JavaScript&quot;! Even though they haven&apos;t really
					done anything with JavaScript itself in ages.
				</p>
				<p>
					Recently, the folks behind Deno (another JavaScript runtime, like
					Node.js) decided to challenge this. Here&apos;s the lowdown:
				</p>
				<ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
					<li>
						Deno asked for the trademark to be cancelled, saying &quot;JavaScript&quot; is
						a generic term now and Oracle isn&apos;t using it properly in business.
					</li>
					<li>
						Oracle&apos;s response? They apparently sent in a screenshot of Node.js
						(which they definitely don&apos;t own) as proof they&apos;re using the name.
						ðŸ¤”
					</li>
					<li>
						Things are heating up! If Deno&apos;s claim of fraud moves forward,
						Oracle might have some explaining to do about that screenshot.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Why care? This could actually affect how freely everyone can use the
					word &quot;JavaScript&quot; in things like conference names, products, or
					developer tools. Deno is pushing to #FreeJavaScript, and many
					developers are watching to see what happens.

					The Funny Parts (aka Debugging)
				</h2>
				<p>
					Ah, debugging JavaScript. It&apos;s a rite of passage. It&apos;s where you stare
					intensely at your code, convinced it&apos;s perfect, while the browser
					insists
					<code>undefined is not a function</code>. It&apos;s like arguing with a
					toddler who just keeps saying &quot;No!&quot; for no reason. But the feeling
					when you finally squash that bug? Pure. Bliss. (Or relief. Mostly
					relief).
				</p>
				<p>
					Remember: The semicolon <code>;</code> is sometimes optional,
					sometimes vital. It likes to keep things interesting. And don&apos;t even
					get me started on
					<code>this</code> keyword... it&apos;s... an adventure.
